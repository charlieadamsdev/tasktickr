TaskTickr MVP Development Document
Project Overview
TaskTickr is a gamified to-do list app that helps users build habits by linking task completion to a "stock price." The app’s stock price rises or falls based on daily task performance, motivating users to stay consistent. Built using React and Supabase, TaskTickr focuses on rapid development with zero-cost tools to deliver a functional MVP quickly.

Core Features
Task Management

Create Tasks: Users can add new tasks with a title and optional description.
Edit Tasks: Modify existing task details.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list.
Complete Tasks: Mark tasks as complete, triggering a stock price update.
Stock Price Tracking

Stock Price Rules:
Completing all tasks in a day increases the stock price by +5%.
Missing any tasks decreases the stock price by -3%.
Base Stock Price: Starts at 10.
Historical Tracking: Tracks daily stock price changes and logs them.
Line Chart Visualization

Displays stock price history in a line chart that mimics stock market trends.
Highlights daily changes based on task completion.
Technical Stack
Frontend: React (using Vite for lightweight, fast development)
Backend & Database: Supabase (Postgres DB, real-time syncing, and API)
Hosting: Vercel or Netlify (free hosting options for fast deployment)
Database Schema (Supabase)
Tasks Table:

id: Unique task identifier.
title: Title of the task.
